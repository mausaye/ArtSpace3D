# Art Space 3D

The Art Space 3D web application provides a solution for artists as it is not only free, but does not contain unnecessary features that come along with todayâ€™s animation and development platforms. It supplies artists with a simple platform on which to design and visualize their ideas in a digital environment. 

On the web application, artists can create references and generate ideas by simulating various physical spaces. On the application, users are provided with a blank three-dimensional canvas into which they can drag, drop, and manipulate various 2D or 3D shapes, such as through color changes. Furthermore, users will be able to rotate and maneuver around the scene while being able to manipulate light sources for shadow casting. In the end, users will be able to use their finalized scene to aid in creating their physical art.
